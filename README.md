## Technologies
* Tech 1 - HTML
* Tech 2 - JavaScript

## Setup
I used the Atoms IDE. It is very easy to download!Just head over to https://atom.io/ .

## Features
* Used event handlers to add movement to the snake.
* Created a randomFoodgenerator function to ensure that the apple rises at random locations everytime we play the game.
* Used a game loop to make this entire game work.

## To-do list:
* In the future I would like to add animations to the face of the snake.
* I would like to create a backend database to store the score.

## Status
Project is:  _finished_
